# Deliverable 5 - Design

*Group 5 - “CS Play”*

## 1. Description
CS-Play is an open-source website that teaches somebody who wants to learn  programming by playing games instead of traditional boring classroom teaching. The user will start the coding adventure by an interactive teaching method that is the most efficient way to learn.

CS-Play is still in early development. The website offers more interactive and game elements as the User Interface, which will give CS-Play an edge to emphasize our value proposition so that attract more new programmers and motivate their interest in programming.

## 5. Code quality


## 6. Lessons learned
Our team has learned that we tend to underestimate how much time it takes to implement things. We wanted to make much more but we realized that 
we would have to decrease our scope quite a bit. We also learned to be flexible when things didn't work out the way we wanted them to and to find 
alternative ways instead. During the development for implementation 2 we still had some of the problems from earlier weeks like working in the same files. 
In Deliverable 4 we mentioned that we had some problems with unorganized code which we solved during this implementation by organizing the repository
and all the files in it. One major obstacle for our group has been computer trouble with multiple members of our group experiencing it at the same time which caused lost code and lost access to the web server located on one members computer. In hindsight it might have been better to choose a platform to host the server that was accessible online to all members instead.
